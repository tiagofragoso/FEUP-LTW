The website is also usable when not logged in, however some actions are restricted.
The website meets all minimum requirements and all of the extra requirements mentioned in the project specification.
As discussed, the website uses a syntax highlighting plugin called PrismJS.

The SQL script is located at /database/snipz.sql
The .htaccess file contains a "harcoded" 404 redirect page based on the UP number of the group elements. It should be changed to 
the corresponding path to the server root to work properly.
